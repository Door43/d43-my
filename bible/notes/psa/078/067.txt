===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.

  * **He rejected the tent of Joseph ... he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim**  - These words mean almost the same thing. The writer uses them both to strongly say that it was not Joseph and his descendants with whom God chose to dwell. (See: [[my:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Joseph ... Ephraim** - Ephraim was Joseph's son.
  * **Judah ... Mount Zion**  - Mount Zion was located in the land where the tribe of Judah lived.
