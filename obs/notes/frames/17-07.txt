But **God** sent **the prophet Nathan** to **David** with this message, “Because you are a **man of war**, you will not build **this Temple** for me. Your **son** will build it. But, I will **bless** you greatly. One of your **descendants** will rule as king over my people forever!” The only descendant of David who could rule forever was the **Messiah**. The Messiah was God’s Chosen One who would save the people of the world from their **sin**.

  * **from sin** - That is, "from the terrible consequences of their sin."
